# List of patches for LLDB

This document contains a list of patches for `LLDB` that are required (or recommended) for `lldb-eval`.

* (Required) `[LLDB] Fix how ValueObjectVariable handles DW_AT_const_value when the DWARFExpression holds the data that represents a constant value`

  > In some cases when we have a DW_AT_const_value and the data can be found in the DWARFExpression then ValueObjectVariable does not handle it properly and we end up with an extracting data from value failed error.

* `[lldb] Add SBType::IsScopedEnumerationType method`

  > Add a method to check if the type is a scoped enumeration (i.e. "enum class/struct").

* `[lldb] Add SBType::GetEnumerationIntegerType method`

  > Add a method for getting the enumeration underlying type.

  Git commit: [1432ae57bf6e4022b6f4541c9225674ee6b19c23](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/1432ae57bf6e4022b6f4541c9225674ee6b19c23)

* (Required) `[lldb] Encode bool as unsigned int`

  > `bool` is considered to be unsigned according to `std::is_unsigned<bool>::value` (and `Type::GetTypeInfo`). Encoding it as signed int works fine for normal variables and fields, but breaks when reading the values of boolean bitfields. If the field is declared as `bool b : 1` and has a value of `0b1`, the call to `SBValue::GetValueAsSigned()` will return `-1`.

  Git commit: [0bab7b26f4d9dc4cb8f6c2877ad4a2c388c41c65](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/0bab7b26f4d9dc4cb8f6c2877ad4a2c388c41c65)

* `[lldb] Lookup static const members in FindGlobalVariables`

  > Static const members initialized inside a class definition might not have a corresponding DW_TAG_variable, so they're not indexed by ManualDWARFIndex. Add an additional lookup in FindGlobalVariables. Try looking up the enclosing type (e.g. `foo::bar` for `foo::bar::A`) and then searching for a static const member (A) within this type.

* `[lldb] Support unscoped enumeration members in the expression evaluator`

  > Add unscoped enumeration members to the "globals" manual dwarf index. This effectively makes them discoverable as global variables (which they essentially are).
